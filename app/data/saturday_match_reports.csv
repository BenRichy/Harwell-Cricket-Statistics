E George 5-1-22-3
S Boag  1-0-2-3


Firstly a hats off to George for working miracles to get the square in decent nick and thank you to all those that helped this morning to get the pitch ready this morning. Having lost the toss, Harwell were put into bat, it was clear from the get go Matt Davies (51)* had his eye in and even as the wickets fell around him, nothing put him off his focus on metronomic scoring through the legside over after over. After Matthew retired on 50 (+1) as per the friendly rules, the writing was on the wall for the Harwell innings. This was highlighted evermore as he was left stranded on his return in the final pairing, without facing another ball. Joe Braham (15) delivered a showreel of shotmaking before his body succumbed to a lack of fitness, but other than that very little more can be said of the Harwell innings. We’ll discuss E Xtra another day….

Now it was the turn of the opening bowlers renowned as the most dangerous partnership in the division, and they didn’t disappoint. Ethin George (5-1-22-3) flashed and spat one past Keyur’s nose in the 1st over. With the Old Harwellian and Garsington danger man only able to fend the ball into James Wilson (2 catches) solid gloves. As the bowling rotation kicked in to ensure all of the attack had a chance to turn over the arm, Stephen Boag (1-0-2-3) clearly didn’t get the memo and dismantled the Garsington middle order just as there was a sign of the Garsington batters settling into the innings. Ben Richmond (2.4-1-3-2) then put the rest of the Garsington locker room to the sword with clinical accurate bowling, and Harwell came out well ahead on a difficult track.


MHFA: James Wilson for solid hands behind the stumps on a variable bounce day.

CM: Joey Braham for the cover drive that kept picking up speed as it barrelled over the ropes for 4.

DoD: Joey Braham just talked himself into it.

MotM: Matt Davies for scoring more than the opposition and easily more than the rest of the Harwell team too. Added to that a wonderful catch, cracking performance from Matt!


It’s always good to get off with a win and hopefully dusted some of the cobwebs off and now roll on the season.

Harwell International CC 1’s
138 for 3 off 27 overs
M Schofield 69*

Losing the toss for the 2nd week on the bounce, Harwell’s opening bowlers were going to be up first to see if they could live up to the crescendo of media hype built up through the winter. Ethin George (8-1-37-2) should have had joy in his 2nd over but the skipper spilled it back in front of him at slip, however it wasn’t long before he was back in the hutch. Max  Schofield (9-0-36-1), toiled away and got his reward in his final over of the first spell with the ball of the day to dismantle the leg stump. the skipper, Toby Gallington (4.2-2-9-3) resided over a mini-collapse with Tom Forrest (2 catches) a phenomenal 1 handed 2 finger caught behind. Stephen Boag (8-1-24-2) and Ben Richmond (3-0-15-1) picked up regular wickets at the other end and Jon Timms (5-1-8-1) sent Letcombe’s top scorer packing with an outstanding catch from Rakesh Shah. The Letcombe tail did wag through the 2nd spell of EthiMax but eventually the last man was ticked off by the skipper.

When it came to the batting Matt Davies 19 was his rock solid reliable opener seeing off Letcombe’s opening bowlers, succumbing to the last ball of their spells. Max Schofield 69,* surprisingly promoted to open to ensure it wasn’t a sea of left handers at the top of the innings, took the opportunity and the game with both hands. A bizarre cameo from the captain (12) perhaps overexcited from his bowling spell and a solid Graham Steven (18) innings helped Max ease Harwell to a win with only 27 overs bowled.

MHFA: Rakesh Shah for ambling over towards the ball to then for the last 4 steps charge forward and hurl himself to the ground to take a screamer.

Note: special mention for the nomination from Max “what gives Boagy the right to play football on a cricket pitch”

CM: Stephen Boag’s 100th league wicket. Congrats Boagy!!!
 
DoD: Toby Gallington for bowling the first extra of the season, dropping a slip catch, losing the toss, taking Max off after his wicket, cringey glove use in pre-match training 

MotM: Max Schofield for some v good bowling but the highlight a display of very mature and accomplished batting that brought the game home with ease in the end.

Steventon CC 1’s
134 all out off 43.2 overs

Harwell International CC 1’s
109 all out off 36.4 overs

And it all started so well…. Ethin George (9-2-25-2) getting Bradders early doors with a great one handed snuffle from James Wilson. Tight bowling and excellent fielding abound, all our bowlers picked up wickets, and all bar one, extremely economical too. Ben 🌶️ Richmond (8-2-18-2) the absolute pick of the stats and as always tireless endeavours in the field to boot. With Steventon 99-8, the team decided to have a brain fart. 7 dropped catches, many of them dollies, a bizarre blind throw from Ethin at his own fielder, not even the wickets, and a smattering of luck going against added another 35 runs to their total. 

However, 135 all out, we were on top. But not for long…. Harwell failed to recover from the shock early loss of our opening stalwart, Matt Davies, and we were staring down the barrel of embarassement at 25-5 before some grit was shown led my Max Schofield (24). It was a day of the tail wagging the dog, with a 350% increase in the number of runs for the last 5 wickets, and agonisingly 1 more top order batsman getting into double figures would have been all that was needed.

MHFA: Graham Stevens for the “G juggle.” Not to be outdone by last weeks triple juggle drop, went for a quadruple juggle catch.

CM: Ethin George caught and bowled, at full height, jumping, one handed.

DoD: The Top Order (including Max)

MotM: Ben 🌶️ Richmond for excellent bowling at a pivotal time in the game, and a lot of bottle with the bat too.

TGFP: Toby Gallington for kicking Jamie Ross out of the Harwell group for chatting about a club that no-one cares about because it’s a Harwell WhatsApp group.

We can’t be too despondent about the overall performance, because we were excellent for large chunks of it and after 3 games, 2 wins and 2nd place is not a bad place to be at all, particularly with the health of the squad and the performances we’ve put in. We go again against Abingdon Vale at home next week, perfect for a bounce back!

Harwell International CC 1’s
50 for 3 off 12.3 overs

A first win of the toss in 2024 and Harwell sent Abingdon Vale into bat on a soft wet pitch. The openers blasted through the Top 3 for a run a wicket and never let up from there. The fielding was excellent, a bullet catch from Graham Stevens and Matt Davies (3 catches), 1 of them, impossibly difficult and still snuffled. Toby Gallington (5-10) took a diving caught and bowled as part of his 5er, partnered well by Stephen Boag (3-10). 

With the bat, the opening pair  looked like they were going to walk it home, before Matt Davies top edged into his own face, horrible to see! Rakesh fell soon after and with the Captain failing to follow his own pre-match words. Graham and Timmsy finished with a flourish.  

MHFA: Matt Davies for 3 catches, 1 good, 1 excellent and 1 outstanding.

DoD: Toby Gallington for not being responsible for his batting and for keeping Timmsy out of the bowling, keeping the field out so Boag’s couldn’t get the 10th wicket so he could get his 5er.

As a repeat of last week, Harwell won the toss and took to the field first. Ethin George (6.2-1-27-2) his usual dangerous self, fizzing the ball through, whilst unfortunately the other was carted around. Thankfully with an lbw from his first ball Lee Gallington (7-3-12-3) really kicked us into gear and not long before Dorchester were reeling. A picture perfect spell from Ben Richmond (5-1-9-2) either side of drinks made him pick of the spinners, and it wasn’t long before Ethin cleared up the last wicket.

An irregular top 4 built a reasonable foundation the highlight being Jayesh Manwani (31), with a very postive innings on his debut. Matty’s run out created a lot of jangling nerves, but this only helped focus Joe Braham (46) (he might have run out Matt). A nod to Jon Timms and Ethin George for disciplined support at the other end facing 40 balls between them for only 1 run. Exuding the very essence of taking responsibility in the game situation!

MHFA: Matt Davies for an excellent catch in the Dorchester slap fielding position.

CM: Lee Gallington bowling Ferris.

Again Harwell won an important toss and took to the field first. It took Max Schofield (6-2-52) 3 balls to obliterate the stumps, nearly impaling James Wilson (2 catches) with the bails. It seems 5 hours to recover from a long haul flight helps Max hit his peak! Ethin George (9-2-20-3) was (and I repeat this from last week) his usual dangerous self, fizzing the ball through. The Galllington Bros picked up 3 wickets between them for very little runs, plus a no ball bowled by Lee, with Ben🌶️Richmond and  Jon Timms adding 1 each. Also, for very little runs. 

In summary, wickets for very little runs was the theme of the 1st innings.

Challow’s low score was also a clear indicator the pitch was a bit of a minefield. Thus thr return to the top of the order for the metronomic Matthew Davies *(33 not out) paid dividends. Clearly focused on the prize after missing out on a catch for the first time this season. Partnered by G Stevens 17* the game was brought home with some careful but positive batting. With that win Harwell move top of the table after 6 games.

MHFA: Lee Gallington “I’ll get it, no I won’t.” Depriving Tommy F of an opportunity to field the ball as a spectator, to only miss it anyway.

A clinical win. Good in the field, excellent with the ball, and solidly navigated a tricky pitch to win with nerves fully intact.

A good toss to lose, and Harwell did just that! Sent into bowl again, perhaps their Skipper hadn’t checked the form book and wasn’t aware of the EthiMax opening attack. It was, however, a very frustrating opening 20 overs with Dorchester style luck raining down on Hendred as leading edges and chips rained down on fielder-less areas of the ground. Perseverance was the key and wickets were unlocked with Ethin George 11-5-20-2 and Ben Richmond 8-2-34-3 the pick of the bowlers. An outstanding catch in the deep by the skipper definitely the moment of the latter end of the innings, and with Hendred restricted to 181 in 47 overs on a good pitch, things looked good for Harwell.

But of course, there is always the Harwell batting to go and make it a stressful day. At 9-2 things weren’t looking great, but a solid partnership of 37 between Graham Stevens (40) and the skipper built a foundation that was kicked on from. Jayesh Manwani (14) gets a note for an absolutely chaotic innings involving a 4, 6, ball hitting the stumps and bails staying on, running out a very set Joe Braham (24) to then get himself out lbw next ball he faced. But when it came to chaos, the best was still to come! Rakesh Shah (20) showing some return to his normal form and some lovely sweeps from Jon Timms (17) gave us a sniff. 

Then came the last over

6 needed from 6
Timmsy out lbw first ball, 

6 needed from 5
Ben Richmond coming to the crease injured with a fully bandaged hand after splitting the webbing between thumb and finger after dropping a catch earlier in the day. No run.

Winning the toss on a glorious sunny day on a track that there was a kin to the A34 Harwell chose to back for the first time this season. James Wilson (26) with an excellent knock up top set a foundation for 50 partnership between Joe Braham (27) and Toby Gallington (51) with helpful runs from Timmsy, G and Rakesh. All in all a steady batting performance that put a decent score on the board on a deceivingly bowler friendly wicket.

The bowling began its usual devastating fashion, albeit with only 1 bowler really getting in the wickets today, Max Schofield 11-3-19-4. A terrific direct hit runout from the skipper follows up from his awe inspiring catch last week. However, Wolvercote shut up shop relatively early and the game fizzled out, albeit with Harwell clearly with the winning draw.

On losing the toss and being sent into bat, there was some dissent from the flightless bird community on the basis that a coin flip is somehow in the captains control.

It didn’t start great to be honest, Matt getting a 1st baller and the number 3 being equal to his strike rate. But with wickets remaining intact, and James Wilson (29) taking to the opener role very well, Joe Braham (31) accelerated in his elegant beautifully timed style and Max Schofield (96) accelerated away ruthlessly. Ultimately, his 100 eluded him, but a chance to control the game had not.

Max Schofield (31-3) coming back from a short rest at tea took the opener early, bowling another excellent opening spell combined with Ethin who searched for a wicket all day to no avail. The same for the skipper, but with James stunning catch off Max, and Lee Gallington (30-2) second spell up the hill reaping rewards, Ben Richmond (24-5) bowled beautifully, adjusting his pace perfectly and ensured Harwell were going to take maximum points today.


MHFA: James Wilson’s all round keeping and obvs the catch.

- Of the best bowlers in Div 7C (by wickets the average), Harwell have 3 of the top 6 and 6 in the top 21
- This season, Max has an average of 165 against Letcombe
- Ben has taken a wicket in every game he's played so far this year where stats are recorded (10 games)
- After Toby's SR of 3.7, he now has the 5th lowest (out of 14 batters) out of people who have batted for Harwell this year 
- 5 people are who have batted for Harwell in the are selfish, in the Cherwell this year, in that they run further whilst facing than they do for their partners. Top of the list is Rakesh, running twice as much for runs off his own shots than for his partner's. James Wilson and Jay have run 58% and 50% more from running off their own shorts than their partners

We wanted to bowl first, but put into bat we declared early and were aggressively confident in backing ourselves, we stay firmly in 2nd but with 2 big fixtures against Cumnor 3rd and Stivvy 1st to come.

Winning a key toss and sending Cumnor into bat, there was many congratulations for the captain from the flightless bird community on the basis that a coin flip is somehow in the captains control.

Said skipper did proceed to drop a catch in the 1st over, but it wasn’t long before Max sent the young man back to the pavilion after accidentally moving Chilli into exactly the right place to catch him. After that, it just became the Chilli show! Ben Richmond (9-13) absolutely outrageous figures, tore the oppo apart.

It was good to see Matt Davies (29) back in the runs and another beautifully crafted innings by Joe Braham (32)* saw us home despite others perhaps ensuring it was always going to be a typical nervy Harwell chase of a low score.

The toss was lost, much to the chagrin of the flightless bird, and Harwell were sent into bat. Matt Davies (8) looked very good building a solid foundation with his partner before falling to an outstanding catch trying to despatch a short ball. The skipper didn’t last that long, before Max Schofield (25) forged a good 50 partnership with the anchor of the entire innings, who delivered a truly sterling performance with the bat, Graham Stevens (104). Quick fire runs from Ethin George (15) and Rakesh Shah (16) saw us into the two hundreds at the turn.

Harwells dominance continued, with Max Schofield (4-53) absolutely tearing through the top order. Hard toil from Ben Richmond (3-31) through the middle overs kept Harwell on top. However, the fielding cannot be overlooked, good focus from all and tireless workrate from our younger players supported our bowlers and backed up our batting. Unfortunately, with 3 overs to go the captain dropped the Steventon number 10 at silly mid off, and Steventon limped over the line.

Having arrived on a beautiful sunny afternoon the first task was the traditional Timms barefoot pitch inspection, which revealed a wicket with a number of toe sized cracks (demonstrated by Timms) and a few dodgy looking patches. Naturally on this bowl first wicket the skipper managed to lose the toss and we were put in to bat!

A typically pointless shaky start saw Harwell reduced to 22 for 3 at the start of the eighth over, but then a 81 run partnership from Joey B (27) and G Stevens (43), who capitalised well on the poor balls, and Joey in particular showed great discipline in keeping out the bad balls. With HICC back on top, Manwani (18), Sooraj (22), Timms (17) and Richmond (23) helped push HICC up to 194, before Ben eventually fell, denying his skipper the chance of a quick fire 30. A very mixed batting performance on a troublesome pitch, but a good score to set! It might be an idea if we put away the sweep to slow, straight off-spinner bowling on middle stump though!

HICC started a bit sloppily in the field, with Ethin bowling well but still avoiding all kinds of luck! Despite the interesting pitch, which produced a couple of Boag off-spinners turning the wrong way, the Abingdon openers remained resolute until a bit of magic from Sooraj cleaned bowled Cummins. The next batsman then strolled out and did a better job of returning the ball to mid-off than the HICC fielders ever could, as Boag didn't need to move to take the catch, Sooraj on a Hat-trick! The skipper moves the field in.... Sooraj bowls a wide! Not to worry though 3 balls later he get another with an LBW. Sooraj then removed the other opener (with a standard Davies catch), Ben chipped in with a bowled and another caught (JGW) and bowled for Sooraj, Abingdon 66 for 7 after 22 overs.

A spirited defence from D Tom and B Smith, with some experimental bowling changes saw Abingdon advance to 108 for 7 in the 34th over, before the reintroduction of Ethin lead to a run out. Young Smith have faced one ball of Ethin and exclaimed what am I supposed to do with that? Desperate to not face him again Smith tried to take a dodgy single, and we promptly messed up the runout, but Smith was off on a Williams style rant, so Boag calmly picked up the ball and managed to hit the stumps despite a very confused and disappointed Timms being in the way (and looking the wrong way). Ethin then finally got wicket clean bowling Tom, before Timms finished them off with the last ball of the 36th over.

Thank you very much to Cordy for scoring and to Toby for not playing!

It was obviously a bit of a minefield wicket, made apparent by the state of James Wilson’s hands. The reality is nobody got themselves in and stayed in like Dorks opener. A couple of very poor lbw decisions given on the left handers but overall not a good day at the office with the bat.

Thank you to Cordy Williams for coming down to score, and Uday, James, and a brief visit from Andy C, for coming down to support!


MHFA: Rakesh Shah for a very good catch, then a non-Joey drop, and a great diving stop later again.

CM: Ethin George’s enormous 6 towards the estate offices.

DoD: Joe Braham for throwing a ball at the lady batters head and bouncing it off her helmet in between overs, and then bowling her.

MotM: Ethin George for  his best bowling spell of the year, bowling some absolute fire at times.

TGFP: Stitch from Dorks team who carried his bat and bowled really well, only after taking 5 minutes every batting over and then every bowling over. An absolute 🔔 end, we’ve never met before.

We make sure we bounce back next week, 4 games to secure our position in Division 6 next season.

COME ON HARWELL !"

Harwell lose by 2 runs

Challow & Childrey CC 3’s
150 all out off 40.3 overs
R Jones-Walters 39
B Richmond 9-0-24-3

Harwell International CC 1’s 
148 all out off 42.3 overs
E George 44


The toss was won, and Harwell chose to bowl first on a grassy wicket. Ethin started with a cracking early wicket before Challow dug in with wickets only falling after small but effective partnerships. Ben Richmond (9-0-23-3) the only “paper job.” But our spinners were very effective at keeping the run rate low throughout the game, Jon Timms (8-0-25-2) definitely in a groove. And all supported by Sooraj Pradeep (6.3-0-29-2).

Then came the Harwell top order collapse, including the skipper running himself out. This was followed by a truly excellent 78 run partnership from Sooraj Pradeep (27) and Ethin George (44) taking us agonisingly close before Ethin was given out very probably incorrectly and our tail just couldn’t hold it out.

Thank you to Cordy Williams and Cordy Williams for being our scorers, and Mumtaz, Syed and G’s sister, the Wilson family and the Davies family for coming down to support! 
(Plus our superfans)


MHFA: Joey Braham for throwing it backwards 

CM: Ethin George spanking the moon ball for a big 4.

DoD: All of the Top Order except the Skipper for not taking responsibility for their wicket and careless in concentration at times, and that is including the skipper who ran himself out.

MotM: Ethin George and Sooraj Pradeep aka Ethin-Soo for good bowling from both and then an amazing partnership when it looked like all out for around 90.

TGFP: Stephen Boag for  standing in last minute, for Raks who fell ill.

This was a gut wrenching loss in the end but only due to specific heroics. A lot of improvement needed instantly, we are back at home vs E&W Hendred and we have a point to prove to ourselves.

COME ON HARWELL !"
